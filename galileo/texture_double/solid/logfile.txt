Classic Lennard-Jones fluid        
Molecular dynamics simulation in NVE ensemble  

Interatomic potential v(r) = 4 * [(1/r)^12 - (1/r)^6]

The program uses Lennard-Jones units 
using method of random velocities: 
target temperature = 0.8
Number of particles = 108
Density of particles = 1.1
Volume of the simulation box = 98.1818
Edge of the simulation box = 4.61329
cutoff r: 2.2
The program integrates Newton equations with the Verlet method 
Time step = 0.0005
Number of steps = 100000

vtail: -0.862908
ptail: -1.72073
size of each bin: 0.0230664
restart = 1
reading configurations from precedent simulation: 
Read initial configuration from file config.0



scale factor: 
0.971389
Initial potential energy (with tail corrections) = -7.5338
Pressure (with tail corrections) = 7.61281
Ekin = 1.2
