Classic Lennard-Jones fluid        
Molecular dynamics simulation in NVE ensemble  

Interatomic potential v(r) = 4 * [(1/r)^12 - (1/r)^6]

The program uses Lennard-Jones units 
using method of random velocities: 
target temperature = 1.2
Number of particles = 108
Density of particles = 0.05
Volume of the simulation box = 2160
Edge of the simulation box = 12.9266
cutoff r: 5
The program integrates Newton equations with the Verlet method 
Time step = 0.0005
Number of steps = 100000
