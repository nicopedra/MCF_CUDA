Classic Lennard-Jones fluid        
Molecular dynamics simulation in NVE ensemble  

Interatomic potential v(r) = 4 * [(1/r)^12 - (1/r)^6]

The program uses Lennard-Jones units 
using method of random velocities: 
target temperature = 0.8
Number of particles = 4000
Density of particles = 1.1
Volume of the simulation box = 3636.36
Edge of the simulation box = 15.3776
cutoff r: 2.2
The program integrates Newton equations with the Verlet method 
Time step = 0.0005
Number of steps = 10000

vtail: -0.862908
ptail: -1.72073
size of each bin: 0.0768881
restart = 0
using method of random velocities: 
Read initial configuration from file config.fcc

Prepare random velocities with center of mass velocity equal to zero 

Initial potential energy (with tail corrections) = -8.71336
Pressure (with tail corrections) = 1.25105
Ekin = 1.2
